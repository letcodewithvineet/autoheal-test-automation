- [ ] Browser ready (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

### Setup Commands
```bash
# 1. Extract project
unzip autoheal-deployment.zip
cd autoheal-deployment

# 2. Configure environment  
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

## üí° Key Talking Points

### Value Proposition
- **Time Savings**: 30 min ‚Üí 2 min per failure
- **Accuracy**: 95% confidence on stable selectors  
- **Scale**: Multi-repo, multi-team support
- **Learning**: AI improves over time

### Technical Highlights  
- **Modern Stack**: React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL
- **AI-Powered**: OpenAI GPT-4o with heuristic fallback
- **Production Ready**: Docker, environment configs
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture

### Business Impact
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer broken tests
- **Faster Delivery**: Less time fixing selectors  
- **Better Quality**: More stable test suites
- **Team Efficiency**: Automated suggestions vs manual fixes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Doesn't Load
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs app

# Restart if needed
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### If No Failures Show
```bash
# Verify database
docker-compose exec db psql -U autoheal_user -d autoheal -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM failures;"

# Should return: 3

# Check API directly
curl http://localhost:5000/api/failures
```

### If AI Suggestions Fail
- [ ] Verify OpenAI API key in .env file
- [ ] Check OpenAI account has available quota
- [ ] System gracefully falls back to heuristic-only mode

## üìù Demo Script Notes

### Opening
"Today I'll show you AutoHeal - our AI-powered solution that automatically fixes failing test selectors. Instead of spending 30 minutes manually debugging each failure, our system analyzes the issue and suggests better selectors in under 2 minutes."

### Transition Points
- **Dashboard ‚Üí Detail**: "Let's see how our AI analyzes this specific failure..."
- **Analysis ‚Üí Approval**: "Now watch how easy it is to approve and deploy fixes..."  
- **Workflow ‚Üí Architecture**: "Behind the scenes, here's the technology powering this..."

### Closing
"AutoHeal transforms test maintenance from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, intelligent workflow. Teams using AutoHeal report 90% reduction in selector-related test failures and significantly faster delivery cycles."
